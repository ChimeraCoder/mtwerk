#MTwerk
###A "fun" alternative to MTurk.

`mtwerk` provides some functions for interacting with the API for Amazon's Mechanical Turk. 

It builds off of code in [goamz](https://launchpad.net/goamz).

It is the "fun" alternative to `goamz/exp/mturk`, because unlike `exp/mturk`, it supports posting of a `Human Interface Task` that is not an `ExternalQuestion`. This means that you can post a task directly, without having to run a server to host the questions yourself.

###Naming
Credit for the naming of this library goes to a #go-nuts user [who insisted upon remaining unnamed in this README](https://botbot.me/freenode/go-nuts/msg/9133861/)

###License

`mtwerk` is licensed under version 3 of the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPLv3). It includes some code from [goamz](https://launchpad.net/goamz), which is released under the same license.
