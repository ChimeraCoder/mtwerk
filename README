MTwerk
===========

`mtwerk` provides some functions for interacting with the API for Amazon's Mechanical Turk. 

It builds off of code in [goamz](https://launchpad.net/goamz); however, unlike `goamz/exp/mturk`, it supports posting of Human Interface Tasks that are not `ExternalQuestion`s. This means that you can post a task directly, without having to run a server to host the questions yourself.


###License

`mtwerk` is licensed under version 3 of the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPLv3). It includes some code from [goamz](https://launchpad.net/goamz), which is released under the same license.
